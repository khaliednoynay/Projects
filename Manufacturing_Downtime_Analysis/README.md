Manufacturing Line Performance Dashboard
Dynamic Interactive Excel Dashboard for Production Efficiency Analysis
________________________________________
Project Overview
This capstone project is a dynamic interactive Excel dashboard designed to demonstrate advanced data analysis and visualization skills in a manufacturing context. Using a practice dataset, the dashboard showcases my ability to analyze production downtime, operator efficiency, and equipment performance, transforming raw operational data into actionable business insights.
The dashboard consolidates production data across multiple product lines (OR-600, DC-600, LE-600, RB-600, CO-2L, CO-600) and demonstrates proficiency in Excel-based business intelligence, KPI development, and interactive dashboard design.

Project Scenario
This project simulates a real-world manufacturing challenge: tracking and reducing downtime across production lines. In manufacturing operations, understanding the root causes of inefficiencies whether operator errors, machine failures, or material shortages is essential for improving productivity and meeting production targets.
This dynamic dashboard demonstrates how data analytics can uncover patterns and drive operational improvements in a production environment.
Key Questions This Dashboard Answers:
•	What is our current line efficiency vs. inefficiency?
•	Which downtime factors have the greatest impact on production?
•	Which operators or products experience the most downtime?
•	How does downtime trend over time?
•	What is the average batch downtime?
•	Are operator errors contributing significantly to line inefficiency?

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard tracks the following critical metrics:
Primary KPIs:
1.	Line Efficiency % - Percentage of productive time vs. total available time (64%)
2.	Line Inefficiency % - Percentage of non-productive time due to various factors (36%)
3.	Total Downtime - Aggregate downtime across all production lines (23:08:00 hours)
4.	Total Worked Hours - Cumulative productive hours across all products (64:18:00 hours)
5.	Average Batch Downtime - Mean downtime per production batch (36:32:00 minutes per batch)
6.	Total Batches - Number of production batches analyzed (38 batches)
7.	Operator Error Rate - Proportion of downtime attributed to human error vs. other factors
Supporting Metrics:
•	Total Worked Hours: 64:18:00 hours
•	Standard Time: 41:10:00 hours
•	Downtime by Factor (Conveyor Belt Jam, Labeling Error, Machine Failure, etc.)
•	Downtime by Operator (Dennis, Mac, Dee, Charlie)

5.	Labeling Error - Human and machine labeling issues
6.	Product Spill - Quality/handling issues
7.	Calibration Error - Equipment setup issues
Operator Performance:
•	Charlie: 6 hours 24 minutes 
•	Dee: 6 hours 10 minutes 
•	Mac: 5 hours 32 minutes 
•	Dennis: 5 hours 2 minutes
Product Analysis:
